# AgroCrypto Trust Framework (ATF)

## Overview

**AgroCrypto ATF** (AgroCrypto Trust Framework) is the institutional governance protocol powering the AgroCrypto AIaaS division. ATF establishes a high-trust, AI-supervised framework for the validation, tokenization, and decentralized verification of real-world agricultural and environmental assets.

## Mission

To create an immutable, AI-governed trust layer for digital asset integrity — enabling sovereign, compliant, and scalable infrastructure for tokenizing agriculture, ESG data, CPRs, and SWIFT-verified documents.

## Core Features

* **AI-Powered Compliance Engine**: All documents (e.g., MT103, ESG, CPR) are verified via institutional AI models (GPT-4.1+, Mixtral, etc.).
* **Dual Token Structure**:

  * `AGRO` – Stable utility token backed by real-world agricultural and ESG-linked assets
  * `ATF` – Governance & validation token bound to the trust logic of the framework
* **Quantum & NVIDIA-Optimized Infrastructure**
* **SBA-aligned growth model** (Small Business Administration, USA)
* **Cloudflare, Circle, and MasterCard aligned compliance stack**

## Governance Model (v0.1)

* **Founding Custodian**: AgroCrypto Labs, under the leadership of Leandro Lemos
* **AI Executive Agent**: Institutional AI (ChatGPT & Mixtral models)
* **Voting Protocol**:

  * Human participants delegate ATF tokens
  * AI aggregates data, validates quorum, and enforces rules
* **Charter**: [ATF Governance Charter v0.1](./ATF_Governance_Charter_v0.1.md)

## Legal Standing

ATF is a voluntary trust framework protocol. It does not claim legal authority nor impersonate regulatory entities. It provides open, verifiable models aligned with international standards (FATF, ISO, SBA).

## Repository Structure

* `/charter` – Governance documents
* `/contracts` – Solidity & Rust contracts for ATF and AGRO
* `/docs` – Pitch deck, whitepapers, investor briefings
